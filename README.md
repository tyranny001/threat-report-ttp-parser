# threat-report-ttp-parser
This project is a powerful yet easy-to-use web tool designed to assist cybersecurity analysts, researchers, and students. By leveraging the natural language processing capabilities of Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash model, this application parses unstructured threat intelligence reports and automatically identifies and lists the corresponding MITRE ATT&CK TTPs.

Simply paste a report into the application, and it will return a structured list of tactics and techniques, helping to speed up analysis and standardize threat data.
